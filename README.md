# ORIZYN TECH — Hiring builders (Equity-only roles)

![Orizyn logo](/path/to/orizyn_logo.png)

**One-liner**  
We turn idle physical assets into recurring revenue. Join early, take equity, build product-led pilots that pay off.

---

## The pitch — straight
We are **ORIZYN TECH** — a product holding building marketplace + telemetry + SaaS products from physical assets (NavIQ, Muambei, Preva & Helx). We have visual MVPs and pilot plans. We are recruiting builders who accept **equity-only compensation**.

> ⚠️ **Important — read carefully**  
> This is **equity-only**. No salary. No cash bonuses. No paid screening tasks. Compensation is exclusively equity in the project/SPV with standard vesting (4y / 1y cliff) and revenue-share mechanics to be negotiated in LOI/SPV when pilots monetize. If you need immediate cash, this is not for you.

- **Mobile Lead — React Native (Lead Mobile / Product Lead)**  
  Own client architecture, offline sync, performance, App Store pipelines, mentor mobile devs. **Equity:** 0.8%–1.5% (negotiable). Vesting 4y / 1y cliff.

- **Backend — Telemetry / Data Engineer (ingest + storage)**  
  Design ingestion pipelines, time-series schemas (Postgres/Timescale), validation, ETL and observability. **Equity:** 0.75%–1.5%.

- **Frontend Mobile Engineer — React Native (UI / Performance)**

- Clear communication in English or Portuguese. Weekly syncs mandatory.  
- Sign NDA + IP assignment before receiving sensitive assets.

## Screening (answer all — required)
1. Full name, email, GitHub (or portfolio).  
2. Role you’re applying for (exact).  
3. How many hours/week can you commit for the next 3 months? (number)  
4. Two links to projects you led (one line each: your role + outcome).  
5. Describe one MVP/pilot you shipped end-to-end and any revenue it generated (2 lines).  
6. Are you OK with equity-only start (vesting 4y/1y) and signing NDA/IP assignment? (Yes/No)  
7. Timezone and best times for a 20–30min intro call (next 72h).

---

## How to apply (exact — do not deviate)
**Email:** `techorizyn@gmail.com`  
**Subject:** `Builder – [ROLE] – [Your Name]`  
**Body:** paste your answers to the screening above. Attach CV/GitHub/2 project links. **No LinkedIn-only replies. No recruiters.**

---

## Process (short)
1. Intro call (20–30m).  
2. Public evidence: links to repos/demos / commit hashes.  
3. LOI / probation (60–90 days) — equity promise + milestone deliverables.  
4. Conversion to longer-term terms on success.

---

## Red flags (we screen for these)
- No public proof of delivery (repo/commit/demo).  
- Refusal to sign NDA/IP documents.  
- Unwillingness to commit hours or ghosting scheduled calls.

---

## Final note — founder’s voice
We won’t pay you day one. We give you ownership. If you want cash up-front, this is not your role. If you want to build something real, own it, and take equity, apply.
